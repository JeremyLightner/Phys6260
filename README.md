# README
## 1a
I do have a github account.  Here is the link to my [github account](https://github.com/JeremyLightner/Phys6260).
## 1b
I know **MATLAB** best. I have used VHDL, C++, Assembly, and Java.  I am learning *Python* now.
## 1c
I hope to gain a more intimate understanding of the discretization of equations.  I will learn *Python* to a functional level, and I will learn proper coding practices.  My stretch goal is to learn how to do more complex physics simulations like modeling a plasma's motion and the EM interactions for applications with **Vacuum Tube Amplifiers**.
